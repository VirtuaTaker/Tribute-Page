            <h3>Timeline of Ada Lovelace's Life:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1815 - On December 10th Ada was born in London, as Augusta Ada Byron. 
                    Legitamate daugther of famous poet Lord George Gordon Byron and Lady Ann Isabella Milbanke Byron.
                </li>
                <li>1823 - Ada was often ill and at the age of 8 she experienced headaches that obscured her vision.
                </li>
                <li>1829 - In June, after a bout with measles, she was left paralyzed and was confined to bed for
                    nearly a year. 
                </li>
                <li>1831 - She was able to walk with crutches. Despite her illnesses, she was able to develop her
                    mathematical and technological skills.
                </li>
                <li>1833 - Met Charles Babbage, a mathematician and inventor. The pair became friends and the much
                    older Babbage served as a mentor to Ada.
                </li>
                <li>1835 - Married William King, who became the Earl of Lovelace three years later. She
                    then took the title of Countess of Lovelace. They had 3 children together.
                </li>
                <li>1842 - Ada was asked to translate an article on Babbage's Analytical Engine that had
                    been written by Italian engineer Luigi Federico Menabrea. She not only translated the
                    article but also added her own notes about the machine.
                </li>
                <li>1843 - The translation and her notes which were much longer than Menabrea's paper, were
                    published in the September edition of Taylor's Scientific Memoirs under the initials A.A.L
                    for Augusta Ada Lovelace. Ada's notes were labelled alphabetecally from A to G. In note G,
                    she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. Considered
                    to be the first published algorithm ever for use on a computer. 
                </li>
                <li>1852 - Died from uterin cancer on November 27th at the age of 36. She was buried next to her father,
                    at the Church of St. Mary Magdalene in Nottinghamshire, England.
                </li>
                <li>1953 - Ada's contributions to the field of computer science were not discovered until
                    the 1950s or about over a century after her death. Her notes were reintroduced to the 
                    world by B.V. Bowden, who republished them in Faster Than Thought: A Symposium on Digital
                    Computing Machines in 1953. The Analytical Engine has now been recognized as an early model for
                    a computer and her notes as description of a computer and software. Ada has received
                    many posthumous honors for her work. In 1980, the U.S. Department of Defense named a
                    newly developed computer language "Ada," after Lovelace.

            <p>"The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jaquard loom weaves flowers and leaves.
               It might act upon other things besides numbers, were objects found whose mutual fundamental relations could
               be expressed by those of the abstract science of operations, and which should be also susceptible of adaptation
               to the action of the operating notation and mechanism of the engine...Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental
               relations of pitched sounds in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of such expression
               and adaptation, the engine might compose elaborate and scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or
               extent. This science constitues the language through which alone we can adequatly express the great facts of the 
               natural world, and those unceasing changes of mutal relationship which, visibly or invisibly, conciously or unconsciously
               to our immediate physical perception, are interminably going on in the agencies of the creation we live amidst. A new,
               a vast, and powerful language is developed for the future use of analysis, in which to wield its truths so that these
               may become of more speedy and accurate practical application for the purpose of mankind than the means hitherto in our
               possession have rendered possible. Thus not only the mental and the material, but the theoretical and the practical in 
               the mathematical world, are brought into more intimate and effective connection with each other."

               --Ada Lovelace. 
            </p>
            <p>"That brain of mine is something more than merely mortal; as time will show."

                --Ada Lovelace.
